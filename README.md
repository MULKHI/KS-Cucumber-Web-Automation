Katalon Studio Automation test using BDD Cucumber

- [x] Feature File in the folder /Include/features

- [x] Step Definitions in the folder /Include/scripts/groovy


## Why using BDD Cucumber
Katalonâ€™s main advantage is its ease of deployment and a wider set of integrations compared to Selenium, the market leader. Katalon has dual scripting interfaces for users with different programming skills. This means that testers with limited technical knowledge can use a simpler user interface that doesnâ€™t require writing code.
