Katalon Studio Automation test using BDD Cucumber

Here I don't use an emulator but use a real device to do testing

## Why using Katalon Studio for Automation Testing
Katalonâ€™s main advantage is its ease of deployment and a wider set of integrations compared to Selenium, the market leader. Katalon has dual scripting interfaces for users with different programming skills. This means that testers with limited technical knowledge can use a simpler user interface that doesnâ€™t require writing code.
